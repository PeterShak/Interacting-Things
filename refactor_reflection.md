During this process, it was really tricky to figure it all out from a video when I had questions that couldn't be answered (I wasn't in school on Tuesday). I kept getting error 
messages for forever and it was really tricky to figure out how to get it to stop. Once I figured out how the  object worked (kinda), it made more sense, but I still have questions I want
to ask. Once i figured it out, it was a case of just fiddeling with it for a few hours to get it to work. Another really annoying part for me was trying to figure out how to make 
the reset function work when a key was pressed. I never understood it when we first went over it, so I had to try to figure out how to do it. It seems like that always the case 
since it seems to change how it works each time. It makes more sense as to why we do the objects, however, I'm still not very confident on how the object actually works. I was able to 
figure it out enough for this project, but it was challeneging. I am proud that I was able to figure out how to make it work despite not being in class on Tuesday. Even though I did 
have the video that explained it to me, it was still challenging to figure out because I wasn't able to ask questions to you.
