During this process it was easy to get started, but hard to finish. I remember much of the code from the last lesson so it was easy to start. But it was hard to do the reset part.
I had to create new functions, simple enough. Until I had error messages for 30 minutes and I couldn't figure out why. They were all saying that my circle() functions weren't getting
a number but rather an empty variable. I tried to redo my variables and rearrange the code. Eventually, I realized that I needed to define the functions in different spots of the code.
I neede the speed() function in the setup() and the pos() function in the draw(). This is because the speed is defined at the start of the code and doesn't change throughout (unless
the balls interact with each other or the walls) while the position is changing constantly throughout the code because the ball is moving through the canvass. It makes much more sense
to me why it has to be done in this way. I was banging my head against a wall and pacing back and forth trying to figure it out. I am proud of how I was able to figure it out and
come up with a very sleek design to my code. It is very simple and makes sense to most computer science people, while still doing the job it needs to do in an orderly and organized 
fashion.
